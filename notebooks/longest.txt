I think in general one of my greatest strengths would be that I stay on top of all of my tasks and I just I really feel like quality is so much more important than quantity and just focusing on the details and making sure that everything is correct and up to the standards that it should be I just think it's important especially with the job I currently have now we get so many tasks so many time-sensitive requests every week so there's always a temptation to work as quickly as possible and get things done on time you don't want to cause any setbacks or have any issues with like for instance stores not getting the price changes that they need for the items that they have on time but most importantly you don't want these stores to get inaccurate prices you don't want to have to worry about the price changes that they need for the items that they have on time but most importantly you don't want these stores to get inaccurate prices so you got to think about what's the most important issue here and really I've learned that you really just not only have to focus on the quality of your work but I feel like one of my strengths that I've been developing since I got brought on full-time with my team is to be able to focus on what needs to come first and kind of devise a sort of plan in your mind about how you're gonna tackle each situation and then you're gonna have to think about what's the most important issue here and really I've learned that you really just not only have to focus on the quality of your work but I feel like one of my strengths that I've been developing since I got brought on full-time with my team is to be able to focus on what needs to come first and kind of devise a sort of plan in your mind about how you're gonna tackle each situation and kind of devise a sort of plan in your mind about how you're gonna tackle each situation especially in situations that are so stressful because you've got you're being pulled in so many different directions and with all these time-sensitive requests you don't want to let anyone down you don't want to let your team down you don't want to let your company down so it's I think I'm good at coming up with plans on how to tackle certain situations and just stay I guess you could say just stay organized um outside of work I'm not typically the most organized person in the world but I feel like in my job especially since it is so important with the nature of the work that I do to stay organized it's just easier to focus on coming up with a plan and sticking to it so that I can make sure that all of my responsibilities are taken care of so I feel like having said all that probably my biggest strength is being responsible and probably one of my biggest strengths is being responsible and probably one of my biggest weaknesses is maybe being too hard on myself and too focused on the little details sometimes and just trying to be perfectionist about every little thing and being just too hard on myself and forgetting that I'm human and and that humans are prone to making mistakes sometimes so
