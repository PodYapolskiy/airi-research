 My best friend would describe me as being a very caring, very giving person. I tend to be more of a listener than coming to people with my problems. So I lend a big ear to people. I'm very easy to talk to. So when you're telling me your problems, I absorb everything. I'm not going to put you off. And I typically make time for anybody who needs it. I'm very good at prioritizing. So I will fit you in when I can, obviously, where adults are busy. Another thing they would describe me as is I'm typically very outgoing, a very loving person, and sometimes to a fault where I give too much of myself to people. I can be maybe too nice, too understanding, too giving, but that's just how I am. I would say my best friend would also describe me as very reliable, very dependable. If I say I'm going to do something, I do it. I follow through with it without having to be pestered, be asked. They have to keep following up with me. Are you sure you're going to do it? If I say I'm going to do something, I end up doing it. I follow through with it without needing to be asked plenty of times. You may have to follow up once with me. I may have lost track of it. I didn't forget to do it. I put it a little on the back burner. And I would say another thing that typically I wear my heart on my sleeve, so to speak. I can be kind of an emotional person, and I take a lot of stuff to heart. Stuff can get to me. I can get kind of frustrated. If something's not going right, right away. I ended up getting through it, but I can get kind of flustered.
