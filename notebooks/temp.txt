 Generally my greatest strength as an employee is my empathy. I'm very good at communicating with others because I'm very good at understanding where they're coming from. Even when they're upset, I can usually deal with people without getting to upset myself. On the other side of that, my greatest weakness as an employee is that I'm shy. I'm good at talking to people, I'm good at communicating with people, but I don't really like to be very social with my coworkers. But I'm good at dealing with customers.
